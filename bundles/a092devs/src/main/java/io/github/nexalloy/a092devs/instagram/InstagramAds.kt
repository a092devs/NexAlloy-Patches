/**
 * The ad injector, the method the ad patches guard.
 *
 * Instagram puts ads into feeds, reels and stories two ways. Some it fetches by an endpoint, which
 * InstagramRequestFilter blocks. The rest it inserts itself, through this one method, which answers
 * whether the item went in; blocking endpoints never stops those, they are how sponsored reels and
 * stories keep appearing.
 *
 * The anchor is HushGram's, the cross-surface one: on 449 and 450 the insert is the only method
 * holding both "cross_surface_duplicate_ad" and "Is ad pod", the strings its debug map is written
 * with. Instagram 451 holds both in one method as well, LX/05gS;->A02(LX/05gS;LX/01h7;LX/04nk;)Z,
 * which answers a boolean. Piko's finder matched "Is ad pod" alone; the second string guards
 * against a method copied around the build without the insert.
